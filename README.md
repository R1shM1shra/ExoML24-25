# Observing the Most Successful ML Algorithm to Differentiate Between Exoplanets and False Positives

This project utilized 4 algorithims, that being a Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and a Non-Linear SVM. 

## **Abstract**
Exoplanets, or planets outside of our own solar system, give us great understanding of our universe. In recent years, the addition of Machine Learning to aid scientists in filtering through potential exoplanets has become prevalent. In this study, numerous types of algorithms, particularly the Non-Linear SVM, D-tree, Random Forest, and Reinforcement Learning algorithms were used. Three data splits of 70/30 training/testing were made, and these splits were kept consistent through the training/testing of all algorithms. Preprocessing on data was done via Python by removing null values and columns that could provide inaccurate results to data. After testing, it was found that the Random Forest algorithm was the most accurate, with its highest accuracy yielding 93%.
